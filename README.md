## Instructions

The object of the game is to score 1000 points. Points are awarded by collecting any gems (100 pts) or reaching the water at the top of the board (100 pts). Points are deducted (50 pts) everytime the player makes contact with an 'enemy' - any of the bugs travelling left to right across the board.

* The player is controlled by using the arrow keys.
* The number, speed, position and colour of the enemy bugs are randomly chosen at the start of each game.
* The number, position and colour of the gems are randomly chosen at the start of each game.
* The game ends once the player reaches 1000 points.
